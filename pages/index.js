       <p>Introduce yourself.  What are your hobbies, favourite music, favourite food, and other things you can tell me about yourself? <strong> I am Jerome Howard S. Miclat, My hobbies are playing video games and building computers. My current favorite music is music by Keshi, Chappell Roan, The 1975, and Valley.
